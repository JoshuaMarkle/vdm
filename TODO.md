# TODO List

## Main

- Add approval system
    - Admin approves users
    - User can login to dashboard but it will say that you must be approved first
    - User can see shifts but not sign up for any shifts
- Add popup card for create shift
- Display shifts with capacity
- Create automation for shifts
- Make admin email recipts
- Integrate with google calendar
    - Display all shifts on some calendar
- Users are able to update their personal info
- Update shift checkin system to list shifts for today
    - Shifts now need: assigned users with user ID, signin time, signout time, and completed boolean

## Extra

- Make the database faster (sorting shifts by date)
- Add REAL security rules (everything becomes a Firebase function)
- Mobile optimization
